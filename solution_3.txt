Task 3 - Q-Learning

Answers:


6) 	Training the Q-learning agent without noise:
        a) Value at state (1, 5): 0.0
        b) Optimal policy : no
        c) Name of parameter: epsilon

7) 	Comparison of values for the start state:
        1) Value of the start state after 300 episodes: 4.31
        2) Average returns from the start state: -13.46

Value of start state after 300 episodes is much better than the average return.
The reason is that, when the Q-Learning agent starts the search, it acts randomly and thus easily get negative rewards.
Therefore, the agent may get many negative rewards at the beginning of a few episodes but would then gradually improve as the training process goes.

8)  Faster converging algorithm? Q-learning
